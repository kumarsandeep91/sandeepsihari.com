Let me give you my brief introduction. I was born at Sihari Daudpur, a small village in Uttar Pradesh state of India. I completed my early education till 5th standard in government school at my village and then I was got selected in Navodaya Vidyalaya, Orai (Jalaun) in year 2002 and remains there till 12th standard. After that I completed my graduation in Mathematics and Chemistry from Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh. But that was not enough for me because I always loved Working, Hacking and Play around with Computers and new technologies so I decided to complete my post-graduation in Computer Science. And completed my post-graduation (MCA) from National Institute Of Technology, Raipur (C.G).
